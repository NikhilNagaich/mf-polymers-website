Hi Ashish,

Good to speak yesterday. Information following up to you information requests below:

1. I have added technical topics to the tab in the Google spreadsheet in "Technical Topics" tab. We will continue to add to these. 
What we realised in doing this is that we cannot put technical detail that is too specific to Ziab. We can put why we are better but not how because the how is a trade secret. Therefore, you can actually write the article since most of the information (e.g. what is a draft angle) is publicly available. What we need to do is only provide the correct photos for you to put in the articles.

2. Calendly: https://calendly.com/contact-mfpolymers/30min

3. Websites we like design: mfpolymers.com, https://parallelfluidics.com, https://hax.co

4. Aesthetic and colour palette for new SmartForge Polymers Website: We actually like the current design aesthetic and colours, possibly this can be refined along thes same lines, I think Ramin is going to work on a more detailed colour palette along the lines of the current platform and will send you this in next 1-2 days but it will be similar to the current MF Polymers website.

5. We are interested to see your logo and structure ideas for the new website.

6. Tech details and more info on our technology and company - see attached grant documents. Some of this is proprietary information (e.g. on customers and LOIs) so this is confidential but can be useful document for you to understand our business. We wouldn't share this if it was too sensitive.

7. Service - our business model is rapid prototyping services and manufacturing services. We enable companies to get their precision plastic products (e.g. medical devices) to market 10X cheaper and 20X faster. We bridge them from R&D prototype to manufacturable product and they can scale immediately using our manufacturing tech/machine instead of the usual 6-12+ months it takes to develop a prototype into a part that can be injection molded using traditional micro-injection molding (traditionally that requires many rounds of modification of both molds and even also the device itself to make it able to be manufactured using injection molding)

8. We will work on a case study from our end and send to you.

Let me know if any other information you need to get on with the work we discussed. 

Please also send the meeting invite for next Wednesday morning.

Best,
Aron
