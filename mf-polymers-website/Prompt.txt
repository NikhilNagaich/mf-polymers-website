Hi Ashish,

Good to speak yesterday. Information following up to you information requests below:

1. I have added technical topics to the tab in the Google spreadsheet in "Technical Topics" tab. We will continue to add to these. 
What we realised in doing this is that we cannot put technical detail that is too specific to Ziab. We can put why we are better but not how because the how is a trade secret. Therefore, you can actually write the article since most of the information (e.g. what is a draft angle) is publicly available. What we need to do is only provide the correct photos for you to put in the articles.

2. Calendly: https://calendly.com/contact-mfpolymers/30min

3. Websites we like design: mfpolymers.com, https://parallelfluidics.com, https://hax.co

4. Aesthetic and colour palette for new SmartForge Polymers Website: We actually like the current design aesthetic and colours, possibly this can be refined along thes same lines, I think Ramin is going to work on a more detailed colour palette along the lines of the current platform and will send you this in next 1-2 days but it will be similar to the current MF Polymers website.

5. We are interested to see your logo and structure ideas for the new website.

6. Tech details and more info on our technology and company - see attached grant documents. Some of this is proprietary information (e.g. on customers and LOIs) so this is confidential but can be useful document for you to understand our business. We wouldn't share this if it was too sensitive.

7. Service - our business model is rapid prototyping services and manufacturing services. We enable companies to get their precision plastic products (e.g. medical devices) to market 10X cheaper and 20X faster. We bridge them from R&D prototype to manufacturable product and they can scale immediately using our manufacturing tech/machine instead of the usual 6-12+ months it takes to develop a prototype into a part that can be injection molded using traditional micro-injection molding (traditionally that requires many rounds of modification of both molds and even also the device itself to make it able to be manufactured using injection molding)

8. We will work on a case study from our end and send to you.

Let me know if any other information you need to get on with the work we discussed. 

Please also send the meeting invite for next Wednesday morning.

Best,
Aron

Great — based on Aron's references and preferences from:

Parallel Fluidics — clean, scientific, highly functional

HAX — bold, startup-centric, edgy, innovation-focused

— and mixing them with the current MF Polymers aesthetic, here are two original design theme directions you can go for:

🎨 Theme 1: "Precision Meets Innovation"
(Sleek, Clinical, Credible – Inspired by Parallel Fluidics with hints of HAX minimalism)

🎯 Design Philosophy
A clean, modular layout emphasizing MF Polymers' technical authority and reliability. Uses lots of white space, subtle animations, and professional typography to reflect trust, scalability, and scientific depth.

🧱 Layout Elements
Hero Section: White background with a technical render/video background loop (like a machine prototype in motion), headline overlay with bold USP like:
“Prototype. Manufacture. Accelerate.”

Grid-Based Layout: 2-column or 3-column blocks with icons or line illustrations (think schematic/blueprint vibes).

Section Separators: Subtle color changes (soft gray/soft blue) and clean horizontal lines.

🎨 Color Palette
Primary: Clinical White (#FFFFFF)

Secondary: Graphite Gray (#333333)

Accent: Cool Blue (#0077B6)

Optional Highlight: Mint Green or Electric Aqua for button hover or callouts

🖋 Typography
Header: Montserrat or Inter (uppercase, spaced)

Body: Roboto or Lato (simple, legible, technical)

Emphasis on numbers, metrics, and facts in bold

📸 Imagery Style
Macro shots of polymer parts

Assembly/tech lab images with high contrast

Overlays with line-drawing schematics or data points

🔗 UX Notes
Sticky navigation with a clean underline hover effect

Quick Calendly integration on top-right

“How it works” section with scroll-based animations

Case studies in collapsible cards or horizontal sliders

🧪 Theme 2: "Bold Tech Edge"
(Startup-driven, futuristic, confident – HAX-inspired with a splash of MF’s clarity)

🎯 Design Philosophy

🧱 Layout Elements
Hero Section: Dark background with glitch text or dynamic outline animation; headline:
“Smarter Molds. Faster Products.”

Split-screen Sections: 50% text, 50% visual mockups with floating callouts

Scrolling Stats Section: Numbers animate as you scroll ("20x faster to market", "10x cheaper", etc.)

🎨 Color Palette
Primary: Jet Black (#0D0D0D)

Secondary: Slate Gray (#1E1E1E)

Accent: Electric Cyan (#00FFFF) or Neon Lime (#B4FF00)

Optional hover: Violet (#8B5CF6)

🖋 Typography
Header: Space Grotesk or Sora – futuristic, bold

📁 PROJECT STRUCTURE:
- Create a proper folder-based project layout:
  - `index.html` — homepage with hero, services, and contact sections
  - `about.html` — about the company and its mission
  - `css/` — contains `style.css` for all styles (or Tailwind if applicable)
  - `js/` — optionally include `main.js` for interactivity if needed later
  - `assets/` — placeholder folder for images, icons, logos
  - `components/` (optional) — for reusable HTML snippets if using templating

🛠 TECH STACK:
- Use semantic HTML5
- Use Tailwind CSS (preferred) or write clean, modular custom CSS
- Fonts and color palette should match the design aesthetic in the theme
- Responsive design: Mobile-first layout with breakpoints for tablet and desktop
- Add internal linking between `index.html` and `about.html`

📌 FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT IN `index.html`:
- Sticky navigation bar
- Hero section with strong headline and CTA button
- Services section explaining SmartForge or MF Polymers services
- Contact section (Calendly integration can be placeholder for now)
- Footer with logo, quick links, and contact info

📝 CODE STYLE:
- Use consistent indentation and spacing
- Comment each section clearly (e.g. <!-- HERO SECTION -->)
- Use class naming conventions (BEM if not using Tailwind)
- Do NOT use any bundler or build system (no Webpack, no Vite)

📦 OUTPUT:
Create all files and folders in the workspace. Don’t combine everything into a single file. Keep it modular and scalable.
